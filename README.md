# dipadanuwar-portfolio

Personal portfolio / static website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This repository contains a client-side portfolio site (single-page) with assets and scripts under the repo root. It is intended to be served as a static website (for example with GitHub Pages or any static host).

## Contents

- index.html — main site entry
- css/ — stylesheet(s)
- js/ — JavaScript code and behavior
- img/ — images and media used on the site
- lib/ — third-party libraries (if present)
- .github/ — repository metadata (workflows, issue templates, etc.)

The repository is primarily JavaScript (frontend), with HTML and CSS for markup and styling.

## Features

- Single-page portfolio layout
- Responsive design (mobile / desktop friendly)
- Interactive UI behavior implemented in JavaScript
- Static assets (images, CSS, libs) included in repo

## Preview

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.

For a local development server (recommended to avoid CORS / file path issues), run:



Or use your editor's Live Server extension.

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages:
  1. Push the repo to GitHub.
  2. In the repository Settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch (root) or the `gh-pages` branch if you prefer.
  3. Save — the site will be published at `https://dipadanuwr-alt.github.io/dipadanuwar-portfolio/`.

- Other static hosts: Netlify, Vercel, Surge, Firebase Hosting — point the service to the repository or upload the built files.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes and test locally.
4. Commit and push: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
5. Open a pull request with a short description of your changes.

If you want formatting, content, or additional sections (e.g., projects list, technical details, license), tell me what to include and I will update the README.

## Notes / TODOs (suggested)

- Add a screenshot or GIF of the site in the README (place under `img/` and reference it).
- Add a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT) if you want to make reuse explicit.
- Add a short "About" / "Contact" section in the HTML or README with your preferred contact details.
- If there are build steps or a package.json later, add the build/run instructions here.

## License

Add a LICENSE file to the repository to make the license explicit (MIT is common for portfolios).

## Contact

If you want me to commit this README.md to the repository, tell me:
- which branch to push to (e.g., `main`), and
- whether to create the commit directly or open a new branch/PR.

Thank you — I can update the README with screenshots, a list of highlighted projects, or any personal text you want included. ****
